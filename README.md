# Mood Bot

[Work in Progress]

A chatbot for Zulip that does sentiment analysis on user's input and attempts to have a conversation with the user.

It connects to the same data store as [Mood Tracker](https://github.com/chena/mood-tracker) to retrieve the set of messages to use in the chats and to identify users (by their email on Zulip).
